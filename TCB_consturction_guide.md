1. 3D Printing Conductive PLA


  The recommended printing temperature of the Conductive PLA (*Electrifi*) is between 140-160째C.
  In our experiment we found that 140째C is too low for consistent extrusion quality on Prusa i3.
  We found that 150째C outputs a good printing quality and reistance. 
  
  
  By default Prusai3's firmware allow minimum printing temperature of 180째C.
  So in order to use *Electrifi*, the firmware file need to be edited.
  
  (You can open the file xx and edit the number after xx to 150 or simply replace file with the provided setup file from this repository)
  Please refer to the screenshot below.
